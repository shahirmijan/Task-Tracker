# Task-Tracker:
This is a very simple application of me building my first application using REACT. This application allows users to create a task as well as mark them as a reminder.  The purpose of this application was purely for self-teaching purposes as I was learning to use React and CSS-LESS.

# Prerequisite:
- Node JS should be installed
- An empty React folder must created using "npx create-react-app [TYPE PROJECT TITLE HERE]"
- Preferably Microsoft Visual Code but any text editor and terminal should do just fine (but in this documentation I will refer to Microsoft Visual Code)
- In Microsoft Visual Code, open your empty react project "folder", open the files explorer panel, click on "Public", and run "npm i react-icons" to install the react icons

# Instructions:
- Assuming the prequisite is done, simply download, then copy and paste my files into your empty react project folder.
- In the terminal run "npm start". Wait for a few minutes for a browser to open with the URL starting with "localhost"

# Tool / Languages / Framworks used:
- HTML
- CSS (LESS)
- React
